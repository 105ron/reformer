# Re-former

A Rail's application to experiment creating forms in HTML to submit to the Rail's server. There are three iterations of the form, the first is pure HTML with ERB generating the authenticity token. The second uses the Rail's `form_tag` helper and lastly a Rail's style form using the `form_for` helper.
